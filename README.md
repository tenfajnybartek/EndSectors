 ✨ Features

- 🚪 **Smooth teleportation**  
  Players can seamlessly move between sectors when crossing borders, with no lag or delay. The system handles sector transitions automatically, making the world feel continuous.

- 🔄 **Real-time player data synchronization**  
  All player data is synced across sectors in real-time, including potions, enderchest contents, gamemode, fly status, inventory, and more. Nothing is lost when switching sectors.

- 🧭 **Shared and synced sector information**  
  Sector-wide information is shared and synchronized across all sectors. Admins can rely on consistent world data and stats at any time.

- 💬 **Global player chat**  
  Players can chat globally, with messages synchronized across all sectors. No matter which sector they are in, everyone stays connected.

- 🧩 **Synced player information**  
  Each player keeps their personal data consistent across all sectors. This includes inventory, stats, positions, and custom attributes.

- 🎯 **Advanced sector queue system**  
  When connecting to the server, the framework intelligently decides which sector to send the player to:  
  - **Last sector (`lastSector`)** – if the player has a recorded last sector, they will return there.  
  - **Random sector** – if no last sector exists, the player is sent to a random sector to balance load.

- ⚡ **Plug-and-play**  
  Simply configure your servers in the YAML file and everything works out of the box. No additional setup is required; teleportation, syncing, and queues are handled automatically.
