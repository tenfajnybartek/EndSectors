# EndSectors

**EndSectors** — advanced Minecraft sector framework for **Paper 1.24.1** with **Mongo & Redis** 🗄️

One large Minecraft world, divided into multiple sectors on a single Spigot/Paper server,
fully synchronized across all players.
Provides seamless border teleportation, global chat, real-time player data sync,
and an advanced queue system, making large map management effortless

> [!WARNING]
> **This branch is currently under active development**
>
> ⚠️ Features may be incomplete or unstable.  
> ❌ This branch is **unstable** and should **not** be used on a main/production server.  
> ✅ Use it only for testing or development purposes.
>
> 💡 Don’t expect miracles – this is just a beta, a lightweight framework for now.  
> It will be expanded and improved over time.
>
> **💥 Sector configuration warning 💥**
>
> ⚠️ In this beta, sector coordinates in YAML may cause players to teleport **slightly before the border**.  
> 🛑 Correct setup (matching the frontend `sectors` array) should be:
>   - Spawn sectors: **-250 / 250**
>   - Other sectors: **251 / 751** (or **-751 / -251** for negative axes)  
      > 🚨 Using the old YAML coordinates (e.g., `250 / -250`) may cause borders to behave weirdly.  
      > 🛠️ Will be fixed in **Beta 1.1**.

✨ Features

- 🚪 **Smooth teleportation**  
  Players can seamlessly move between sectors when crossing borders, with no lag or delay. The system handles sector transitions automatically, making the world feel continuous.

- 🔄 **Real-time player data synchronization**  
  All player data is synced across sectors in real-time, including potions, enderchest contents, gamemode, fly status, inventory, and more. Nothing is lost when switching sectors.

- 🧭 **Shared and synced sector information**  
  Sector-wide information is shared and synchronized across all sectors. Admins can rely on consistent world data and stats at any time.

- 💬 **Global player chat**  
  Players can chat globally, with messages synchronized across all sectors. No matter which sector they are in, everyone stays connected.

- 🧩 **Synced player information**  
  Each player keeps their personal data consistent across all sectors. This includes inventory, stats, positions, and custom attributes.

- 🎯 **Advanced sector queue system**  
  When connecting to the server, the framework intelligently decides which sector to send the player to:
    - **Last sector (`lastSector`)** – if the player has a recorded last sector, they will return there.
    - **Random sector** – if no last sector exists, the player is sent to a random sector to balance load.

- ⚡ **Plug-and-play**  
  Simply configure your servers in the YAML file and everything works out of the box. No additional setup is required; teleportation, syncing, and queues are handled automatically.
