**EndSectors** — experimental Minecraft sector framework for **Paper 1.24.1** with **NATS & Redis** 🗄️⚡

EndSectors allows you to run a single **Minecraft world** across multiple **Spigot servers**, each representing a **sector**.  
All sectors are connected via **Velocity**, giving players the feeling of one seamless world.

- Each sector has its own **boundaries** (default 10k per axis)
- Players can move seamlessly between sectors
- Player data (inventory, gamemode, enderchest, etc.) is synced in real-time via **Redis**
- Inter-server messaging and packets are handled by **NATS**
- **Common service** coordinates proxy and sectors, handles core logic, and ensures proper communication

> [!WARNING]
> This project is **experimental** and **not intended for production use**.  
> It is designed for testing and learning sector-based world mechanics.

## 🔹 Architecture

- **Common Service (The Brain)** – The core of the system. It processes logic and monitors the network. **If Common stops, all connected servers automatically shut down** to ensure data safety.
- **Velocity Proxy (The Connector)** – Merges all sectors into one seamless world and handles player switching between servers.
- **Spigot Sectors (The Game)** – Dedicated servers running specific parts of the world. They detect sector boundaries and sync with the rest of the system.
- **NATS** – The high-speed transport layer responsible for **all packet communication** between services.
- **Redis** – Strictly used for **data storage** and synchronizing player state (inventory, enderchest, stats).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🌍 Map Consistency is Critical**
> For the illusion of a single world to work, **all sector servers MUST use the exact same world map** (identical `world` folder).
> 
> **Example:** If you have a fully built spawn on `spawn_1`, you must upload **this exact world folder** to all surrounding sectors (`w1`, `n1`, `s1`, `e1`).
> The terrain and builds at the border must perfectly match across all instances. Do not try to split the map file manually.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Common service** – must be running before proxy or sectors!
- PaperMC / Spigot 1.20+ (tested on 1.24.1)
- Velocity proxy
- Redis for player data caching
- NATS server for messaging

---

## ✨ Features

- 🚪 **Seamless teleportation** between sectors
- 🔄 **Real-time player data sync** across sectors
- 💬 **Global chat** across all sectors
- 🎯 **Sector queue system** – handles load balancing and last known sector for players
- ⚡ **Plug-and-play** – configure JSON and sector management is automatic

---

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Start the Common service first** – EndSectors relies on it for proper operation.  
   Run it using:

   ```bash
   java -jar common-{VERSION}-BETA-all.jar
